This is particularly true when it is known that data will only be accessed on the device or host, and the cost of migrating data can be reclaimed in exchange for the fact that no automatic on-demand migration is needed.\n",

Too much pinned memory can interfere with CPU performance, so use it only with intention. Pinned memory should be freed with `cudaFreeHost`.\n",
